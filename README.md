# NewNewTerm
This is a rewrite of the original NewTerm/Mobile Terminal project. Mobile Terminal's codebase dates from the iPhone OS 2.0 - 3.0 era, and prior to this it was written for iPhone OS 1.0 (before an official SDK existed). There have been many significant improvements to iOS frameworks since then, so it was decided the best way to go from here was to rewrite the majority of the app.

Compilation is done with Theos. Xcode project is included for convenience. Make sure you build the "NewTerm Theos" target.
