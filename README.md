NewTerm is a full terminal emulator app for iOS and macOS. It features first-class iPhone, iPad, and Mac support, a tab-based interface, and multi-window support on iPad, as well as support for modern terminal features such as extensions created by the iTerm2 project, and more.

It’s the perfect companion for running quick commands directly on your iPhone, or working on projects on your iPad side-by-side with other apps, or SSHing to a server that crashed while you’re on vacation.
