NewTerm is a continuation of the Mobile Terminal project, a versatile terminal emulator for iOS. It includes many improvements over Mobile Terminal, such as a tab-based interface, a selection of themes and fonts, copy and paste, and various bug fixes. It’s the perfect companion for running quick commands directly on your iPhone, or working on projects on your iPad side-by-side with other apps, or SSHing to a server that crashed while you’re on vacation.
